\begin{document}
\maketitle

Here I'll go over the fundamentals of Neural Network and Machine Learning as well as the some applications and practical applications. Then I'll go over the fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning from the typical formalism to some of the latest methods and algorithms.

Before we even go over neural network, I do believe in having a strong foundation in the subject and a clear mathematical formalism. This allows for a subject's mathematical description of methods to speak to us in a clear and understandable language forming a clear picture.

\section{Introductory Mathematics}

\subsection{Formalism}

In this paper, I heavily rely on the formalism typically expressed in linear algebra textbooks. This allows me to relay the most important information, intuitively, while preserving exactness.

To describe a scalar, mathematically, a standard letter a used. For instance $a=1$, where I assign the variable $a$ the scalar value of $1$. To describe a vector, an arrow is placed above a variable to denote it as a vector, $\vec{v}=\vec{0}$ denotes a variable $\vec{v}$ assigned the zero vector. A vector can be described as an element of n-dimensional Euclidean Space where each element of the vector denotes an axis of said space. $$\vec{x}=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 3\end{bmatrix}$$ is an example vector in 3 dimensional euclidean space. This same vector is denoted as a row-wise vector, where all the elements of the vector are on a single row, a column-wise vector would look like $$\vec{x}=\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 2 \\ 3\end{bmatrix}.$$ The significance of the distinctions between a row-wise and column-wise vector are show when going over the matrix as in some operations they have different results and making a distinction matters. From now on when a vector is shown and is not other wise said assume the vector is in column-wise form. 

Another form that a vector can be expressed in is via summation notation. In this notation, we must first define the following unit vectors, $$\hat{r}_1=\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0\end{bmatrix},\hat{r}_2=\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 0\end{bmatrix},\dots,\hat{r}_n=\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 1\end{bmatrix} .$$ Each element of said vector can then be denoted as $$\vec{x}=x_1 \hat{r}_1 + x_2 \hat{r}_2 + \dots + x_n \hat{r}_n$$ and finally using sigma notation, $$\vec{x}=\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \hat{r}_i.$$ This notation is important to properly display information and proofs that would be difficult to display using the previously show forms. One example proof is the proof for the vector's associativity axiom, $\vec{u}+(\vec{v}+\vec{w})=(\vec{u}+\vec{v})+\vec{w}$.
\begin{proof}
\begin{align*}
\vec{u}+(\vec{v}+\vec{w})&=(\vec{u}+\vec{v})+\vec{w} \\
&=\bigg(\sum_{i=1}^nu_i \hat{r}_i+\sum_{j=1}^n v_j \hat{r}_j\bigg)+\sum_{k=1}^n w_k \hat{r}_k\\
&=\sum_{i=1}^n (u_i\hat{r}_i + v_i\hat{r}_i) + w_i\hat{r}_i\\
&=\sum_{i=1}^n \big((u_i + v_i) + w_i\big)r_i\\
&=\sum_{i=1}^n \big(u_i+(v_i+w_i)\big)r_i&\text{scalar's associativity}\\
&=\vec{u}+(\vec{v}+\vec{w})
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Matrix Operations}

In this section, I will go over the common matrix operations that are used in Machine Learning. Firstly, a matrix is basically a table of mathematical expression or numbers arranged in columns and rows. For example, $$A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}.$$ Both row vectors and column vectors can be seen as matrices with a single row or a single column.

\subsubsection{Component-wise Operations}

Component wise operations like multiplication, addition, and subtraction can be denoted on a per component basis. $$(A\square B)_{ij}=A_{ij} \square B_{ij}$$

The $\square$ symbols represent the different possible component-wise operations like multiplication, add, subtraction, and even division.

\subsubsection{Matrix Multiplication}

Matrix Multiplication is the most heavily used operation in Machine Learning. It's definition is simple, in summation notation, $$(AB)_{ij}=\sum_{k=1}^n A_{ik}B_{kj}.$$

\subsubsection{Kronecker Product}

Kronecker is a little less known but extremely use product that makes mathematical definitions in machine learning simpler. It is defined as $$(A\otimes B)_{ij}=A_{\floor{(i-1)/p}+1,\floor{(j-1)/q}+1}B_{(i-1)\%p+1,(j-1)\%q+1}.$$ A matrix with dimensions $p\times q$ will result in a matrix of dimensions $pm\times qn$.

\section{The Agent and it's Environment}

According to "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" by Russel and Norvig an agent as "anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators." For instance, an autonomous car will have the roads and the area around the roads as it's environment, it perceives through the various IR, radar, and visual sensors around the car. The autonomous car will interact with it's environment through it's various actuators, the accelerator, the brake, and the steering. 

In terms of the environment I will be describing the agent will be a satellite that is orbiting a pseudo-earth with a heavier atmosphere, to simulate an accelerated orbital decay. This is acceleration is because the forces of orbital decay are fairly minute so, in order to create an agent in a reasonable amount of time with reasonable amount of computational resources this is done. Of course, this is a hyper-parameter that can be changed in the future to continue research into creating a more long-term agent.  

The satellite's actuators is would be it's engines which generate thrust and it's angle of thrust. The goal of the agent would then be to try it's best to maintain it's orbit. The performance measure would be a function of the amount of time it stays within a certain threshold from it's orbit altitude. A more detailed and mathematical description is explained in a later section.

\begin{table}

Low Earth Orbit & The engine and it's angle of thrust. & Relative position, velocity data with respect to earth and it's target orbit, as well as it's current angle and thrust. \\ \hline

\section{Classic Methods}

Before we dive into ML then RL we need to have a strong foundation in the Classical Methods which makes analysis of ML methods easier and simpler. A house needs a strong foundation. Of course, I'll go over them in passing as they can be examined in detail.
