\chapter{Environment}\label{ch:environment}

This chapter aggregates the previous information and introduces the Reinforcement Learning environment that simulates an initial circular orbit of a satellite in low earth orbit and an accelerated Orbital Decay. The initial conditions, the dynamics of the system, the action and observation space, a distributed optimization of PPO algorithm's hyper-parameter, an evaluation of PPO within this environment, and an analysis of the resulting PPO agent.
