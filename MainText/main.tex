\Abstract{%
In this thesis, a Reinforcement Learning Environment for orbital station-keeping is created and tested against one of the most used Reinforcement Learning algorithm called Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). This thesis also explores the foundations of Reinforcement Learning, from the taxonomy to a description of PPO, and shows a thorough explanation of the physics required to make the RL environment. Optuna optimizes PPO's hyper-parameters for the created environment via distributed computing. This thesis then shows the results from a benchmark and analysis of the produced PPO based agent.
