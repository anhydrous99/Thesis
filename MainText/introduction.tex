\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}

Reinforcement Learning is starting to be prevalent in many fields and applications, including Autonomous Driving, Robotics, Transportation, in Science and Engineering, and many more. A lot of recent research has started in applying Reinforcement Learning in Space and space fairing vehicles. The benefits are better computational requirements from switching from classical numerical methods to a Reinforcement Learning based approach. The goal is to create an environment for detailed evaluations of RL algorithms, current, and future, in Station-Keeping, maintaining a satellite's orbit.

Many of the principles of SAR imaging are applicable to other fields such as
acoustics, geophysics, and medical imaging. In particular, it has been shown
that spotlight-mode SAR can be described as a tomographic reconstruction problem
and can be analyzed using the projection slice theorem from computer-aided
tomography\cite{Garza:2011fk}
